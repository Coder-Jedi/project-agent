# Project Agent

A comprehensive AI-powered project management system designed to transform traditional project coordination into intelligent, automated orchestration through multi-agent architecture.

## Purpose

This project aims to develop a sophisticated AI agent system that automates and enhances project management workflows by leveraging specialized AI agents for different aspects of project execution, monitoring, and optimization.

## Project Structure

```
project-agent/
├── product/                    # Product definition, documentation, and design flows
│   └── brainstorming/          # Research, analysis, and conceptual documents
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## Future Structure

This is a monorepo that will expand to include:
- Frontend applications
- Backend services
- AI agent implementations
- Infrastructure and deployment configurations

## Getting Started

The project is currently in the research and design phase. Key documentation can be found in the `Product/` directory.
